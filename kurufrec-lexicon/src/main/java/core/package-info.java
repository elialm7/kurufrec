/*
*  If you are just checking this repository for any reason,
*  the naming of the classes might be verbose, there's a reason why,
*  the classes currently follow this naming
*  <library origin><dictionary type><purpose|clasification|interface it implements>
    hence you can se classes like: KuroIpadicTextTokenizer
    * kuro -> from the kuromoji library
    * ipadic -> the dictionary the library uses
    * TextTokenizer -> the main interface it implements
    * if i were to write my own tokenizer for the japanese language, i'd use simpler and straightforward names.
    * for now i need to distinguish the implementation and anything unique related to it.
